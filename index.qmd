## Overview


Polars provides an open source library for data manipulation that allows fast, 
large-scale data work in multiple analytics languages.  While many people try
Polars because of its reputation for speed and its ability to handle extremely 
large data collections, most people are charmed by Polars expressive syntax that
promotes clean code and focused analytics.

In the words of Janssens and Nieuwdorop (2025):

> "Come for the speed, stay for the API"

In this workshop, we will explore:

- What is polars
- Why would I use polars
- How can I import data
